The following license is believed to be legally equivalent to the BSD, MIT,
and ISC licenses. The text of the license was first written by Alexander E
Genaud in October, 2005 ( http://genaud.net/2005/10/poetic-license/ ),
who hopes others will use and improve the license. Variations such as
singular 'I' versus plural 'we' and a rearrangement of the final line are
common. Use of the license itself does not require its own notice.
