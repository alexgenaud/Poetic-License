The following license is believed to be legally equivalent to the BSD, MIT,
and ISC licenses. The text of the license was first written by Alexander E
Genaud in October, 2005 ( http://genaud.net/2005/10/poetic-license/ ),
who hopes others will use and improve the license. Variations such as
singular 'I' versus plural 'we' and a rearrangement of the final line are
common. Use of the license itself does not require its own notice.
Permission is granted hereby, to copy, share, and modify. Use as is fit,
