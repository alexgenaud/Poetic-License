Poetic License

The following license is believed to be legally equivalent to the BSD, MIT,
and ISC licenses. The text of the license was first written by Alexander E
Genaud in October, 2005 ( http://genaud.net/2005/10/poetic-license/ ),
who hopes others will use and improve the license. Variations such as
singular 'I' versus plural 'we' and a rearrangement of the final line are
common. Use of the license itself does not require its own notice.

Change Log:
====================

June 14, 2011:
 - Claiming "We’ve done our best" might have legal implications. Best to remove and replace with a statement stopping all claims. (Xeoncross)
