The following license is believed to be legally equivalent to the BSD, MIT,
and ISC licenses. The text of the license was first written by Alexander E
Genaud in October, 2005 ( http://genaud.net/2005/10/poetic-license/ ),
who hopes others will use and improve the license. Use of the license itself
does not require its own notice.

Liability Version
=================

The wording for the original included a phrase claiming "We’ve done our best,
to debug and test." which might constitute or construe a warranty or use.

The license also seemed week when removing all types of liability from the party
in question.

This updated license is released to the public domain.
