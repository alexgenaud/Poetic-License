# LIMERICK Poetic License

    Permission is granted hereby,
    to copy, share, use, modify,
        for purposes any,
        for free or for money,
    provided these notices multiply.

    This work "as is" we provide,
    no warranty express or implied,

    Liability for damages denied.

Set the LIMERICK Poetic License as Your project's `LICENSE` or `LIMERICK`
file and consider including the LIMERICK in Your `README` and source files.

The LIMERICK Poetic License is a fun, simplified, easy to read alternative or supplement to the MIT and OpenBSD permissive licenses.
The permissions most closely resemble OpenBSD's ISC license and the disclaimer most closely resembles the MIT Expat license.
The LIMERICK Poetic License is the best of these better worlds.


## 2024 "provided notices edify ... multiply"

While I hope the poem will `edify`, the notices must first `multiply`.


```
    Confusing legalese is abhoring.
    MIT LICENSE: suffient yet boring.
        LIMERICK file inspires,
        Transparency requires,
    these umpteen rhymes included within.
```

By comparing the similarities of various popular permissive licenses,
their redundancies, and differences,
one can see the simple advantages of the LIMERICK Poetic License.
It gets to the point, encourages reading and understanding,
for casual readers and lawyers alike.

Compare the [LIMERICK, MIT, ISC, and BSD](./compare-limerick-mit-isc-bsd.md) variants.


### LIMERICK or LICENSE or both?

I've been told by some who lack humour
that the LIMERICK Poetic License is not legally robust,
is not boring enough, and has not yet been challenged in court.

The LIMERICK Poetic License is a living poem and not versioned.
It is set in light, not in stone.
Modify it and share your changes if it pleases You.

I am no lawyer, certainly not Your lawyer,
and as of 2024, no one has ever paid me for poetic advice.
Yet, by Prometheus,
I encourage You and grant You permission to assert the
LIMERICK Poetic License as the sole LICENSE of Your project.

Should a "proper" MIT, MPL v2, Apache v2, or GPL-esque LICENSE
tempt You, then may it please You to gracefully demote
these hallowed rhymes to a mere LIMERICK file
in Your project where README and other shouting files hail.


### Ramblings about other licenses

The venerable [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
is slipping against Entropy in the cosmic battle for Truth, Peace, and Freedom.
Something like the [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html) may emerge from the canobalistic
[dust cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license).
The [MPL v2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)
best articulates what developers
intuitively believe open source is and should be;
but it may have been too long, seemingly complicated, and
unpopular by accidents of history.
OpenBSD's [ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD) grants clear permissions,
[MIT](./licenses/MIT0) has a simple disclaimer, and
[BSD](./side-by-side.md) is no lesser salad of legalese.
The [Apache v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
is MIT's verbose brother with novel patent protections.
The [LIMERICK Poetic License](./LIMERICK) is the best of all licenses.


## 2023 "permissive licenses side by side"

The [LIMERICK Poetic License](./LIMERICK)
is a permissive open source software license
believed to be, in spirit and poetically, equivalent to OpenBSD's
[ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD) and [MIT](./licenses/MIT0) Expat Licenses.
Specifically, the chimera most closely resembles the OpenBSD ISC notice
followed by a distilled intersection of BSD, ISC, and MIT warranty disclaimers.

See additional limericks [side-by-side](./side-by-side.md) permissive license snippets.


## 2022 "unmerchantable shit"

Pro: Matches the pattern of the ISC notice closely.
Con: Vague object of notice: alt "use this thing, free or for bling".

## 2013 "no purpose fit"

## 2005 "done our best, to debug and test"
