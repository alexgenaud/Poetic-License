The [Limerick Permissive License](./LICENSE) is a permissive open source software license
believed to be, in spirit and poetically, equivalent to the
[ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD) and [MIT](./licenses/MIT0) Licenses.
Specifically, the chimera most closely resembles the OpenBSD ISC notice
followed by a distilled intersection of BSD, ISC, and MIT warranty disclaimers.

See additional limericks [side-by-side](./side-by-side.md) permissive license snippets.
