# Poetic License

The [Poetic License](./LICENSE) is a permissive open source software license believed
to be, in spirit, if not legally and poetically, equivalent to the [ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD) and the
[MIT](./licenses/MIT0) Licenses. More specifically, the notice is most similar to the ISC
and secondarily to the Expat MIT License. The disclaimer is the
intersection of various BSD, ISC, and Expat MIT Licenses. NB: Denial of Merchantability
and Tort is common to those but (unfortunately) missing from the below license limerick.
