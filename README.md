# Poetic License

The [Poetic License](./LICENSE) is a permissive open source software license believed
to be, in spirit if not legally and poetically, equivalent to the
[ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD) and [MIT](./licenses/MIT0) Licenses.
The notice is most similar to the ISC and somewhat to the Expat MIT License.
The disclaimer is the intersection of various BSD, ISC, and MIT Licenses.
NB: Denial of Merchantability and Tort is common to most of those prior license inspirations,
but have regrettably not yet been translated to limerick.

## Poetic License Version History

Grammar "as is" provided, no warranty express or "implieded".

### 2022 (version 2) "for purposes any, for free or money")

Pros: Matches the pattern of the ISC notice closely.
Maybe: Consider including innovations from Apache 2.0.
Maybe: Avoids the and or and/or debate, for better or worse.
Cons: Notice does not mention object: "use this thing, free or for bling"
Cons: The poetic rhythm has reduced its original spring.
Cons: Should deny merchantability and liability for tort.

### 2005 (version 0) "our best, to debug and test"

Pros: Refers to 'work' early (not necessarily Software only)
Cons: Over-promises "best, debug and test", implies usability and fitness.
