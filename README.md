## What's new in 2024

Set the LIMERICK Poetic License as Your project's
`LICENSE` or/and `LIMERICK` file
and consider including the LIMERICK
in Your `README` and source files.

Optional self-referential middle verses,
summarizes poetically, my thoughts in prose here.

I've dropped the pretense that the
LIMERICK Poetic License is versioned, legally binding,
or that any boring person takes poetry seriously.

My unapologetic software licensing opinions.

The [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
the tragic warrior of Freedom, Truth, and everything Good
may forever lose to Entropy.
The [MPLv2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)
best articulates what developers
intuitively believe open source is and should be;
but alas it was too long, complicated, and
unpopular by accidents of history.
The [MIT](./licenses/MIT0),
[BSD](./side-by-side.md),
[ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD),
and similar are short but no less spam salads of legalese.
The [Apache v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
is MIT's longer and younger brother
with novel patent protections.
The LIMERICK Poetic License is the best of all licenses,
in all ways without compromise ... except:

I've been told by lawyers and others who lack humour
that the LIMERICK Poetic License is not legally robust,
not boring enough, and has not yet been challenged in court.

I am no lawyer, certainly not Your lawyer, nor a certified comedian,
and as of 2024, no one has ever paid me for poetic advice.
Yet, by the great Promethean powers vested in me,
I encourage You and grant You permission to assert the
LIMERICK Poetic License as the sole LICENSE of Your project.

Should a "proper" MIT, MPLv2, Apache v2, or GPL-esque LICENSE
tempt You, then may it please You to gracefully demote
these hallowed rhymes to a mere LIMERICK file
in Your project where README and other shouting files hail.

Certainly replace the year and name,
alter I/we as appropriate,
reference other "real" licenses, etc.
Whether You keep the LIMERICK Poetic License "as is"
or make it more fun, more clear, or less boring,
I can only hope and kindly request
that You share Your inspired verses
in the free and open source spirit.


## 2023 Limerick Permissive License (LPL v2)
## "like anyone gives a" legalese pretense

The [LIMERICK Permissive License](./LIMERICK)
is a permissive open source software license
believed to be, in spirit and poetically, equivalent to the
[ISC](./licenses/ISC_OpenBSD) and [MIT](./licenses/MIT0) Licenses.
Specifically, the chimera most closely resembles the OpenBSD ISC notice
followed by a distilled intersection of BSD, ISC, and MIT warranty disclaimers.

See additional limericks [side-by-side](./side-by-side.md) permissive license snippets.

### 2022 (LPL v2) "unmerchantable shit"
